    "# PixelCNN\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained at the end of the Na√Øve Face Generation notebook, to effectively generate images we need to sample each pixels given te surrounding one. This notebook presents an early approach to construct a model able to do that called **PixelCNN**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize mathematically the problem, $p(x)$ represent the pixels distribution of an images. Which is equivalent to the joint probability of each pixels $p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. Modelizing the whole joint probability is too expensive, thus we made the hypothesis that $p(x_i) = p(x_i | x_{i-1})p(x_{i-1})$. Meaning that te probability of the pixel $x_i$ only depends on the previous pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplification makes it easier to compute the whole probability of an images that could be rewritte like that given our assumption :\n",
    "$p(x_n | x_{n-1})...p(x_2 | x_1)p(x_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "PixelCNN will learn the parameter of those distribution based on example. In this notebook we are going to generate numbers from the **mnist** dataset. First part of the code will focus on the loading and pre-processing of the dataset."
